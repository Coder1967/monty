# monty language :
 Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python).
 It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it.
 The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files. 
# push & pall:
 push adds number to the stack and pall prints all number on the stack 
# pint:
 prints out the top of the stack 
# pop:
 removes element at top of stack
# swap:
 swaps the top 2 elements in the stack 
# add:
 adds the top two elements on the stack and replaces the top with the result
# pchar:
 Prints out the ascii character of the number on top of stack
# sub, mul and fdiv:
 Subtracts, multiplies and divides the top of stack from the second on stack respectively
# mod:
 Gives the reminder from diving second of stack by top of stack
# rotl:
 Rotates the top of stack to last
# rotr:
 Rotates the bottom of stack to stop
# pstr:
Prints a string using the ascci characters of the integers on the stack
