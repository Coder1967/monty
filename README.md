#monty language :
 Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python).
 It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it.
 The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files. 
# push & pall:
 push adds number to the stack and pall prints all number on the stack 
# pint:
 prints out the top of the stack 
# pop:
 removes element at top of stack
# swap:
 swaps the top 2 elements in the stack 
# add:
 adds the top two elements on the stack and replaces the top with the result
