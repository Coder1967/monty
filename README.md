#monty language 
Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python).
 It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it.
 The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files. 
# task 0:
 push & pall push adds number to the stack and pall prints all number on the stack 
# task 1: 
pint prints out the top of the stack 
# task 2: 
pop removes element at top of stack
# task 3: 
swap swaps the top 2 elements in the stack 
# task 4: 
add adds the top two elements on th stack and replaces the top with the result
